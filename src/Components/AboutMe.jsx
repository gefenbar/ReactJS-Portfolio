                        Highly motivated and proactive Computer Science graduate, eager to learn
                        and contribute in a tech-leading company. Collaboration is a key value
                        for me, and based on my experience of working in a development team it
                        is an important part of the environment I would like to work in. I am a
                        quick and independent learner who is always excited about learning new
                        technologies and getting better as a programmer.
